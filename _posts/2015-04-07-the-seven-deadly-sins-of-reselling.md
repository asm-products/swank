##The Seven Deadly Sins of Reselling
 
**Avarice:**

Keeping most of your valuable finds for yourself rather than selling them as planned. If you have more money going out to these items than coming in for an extended period of time, and you see nothing wrong with it, you may need to reconsider. If you get too overly attached to certain items in your inventory, you can create alot of clutter from mixing your "personal items" with things that you will actually allow to be sold. Hoarding can quickly become the poision apple in your reselling business.
 
**Slacking:** 
Although being a reseller seems as simple as buying low and selling high, and working at your own hours it requires more discipline than a regular 9 to 5 because you are self employed. If you do not show up for work: (sourcing, listing, shipping, buying supplies, customer support), you will eventually have no profits to show for it.

Most Resellers are in a position where they take care of the basic operations and on the surface look to be operating well, but do not know how they are doing in regards to Bookkeeping and time management. Poor research on items leads to having a surplus of items that sell very slowly, or not at all (resulting in loss).

Customer service is a crucial part of the sales equation and skimping on compassionate care in lieu of automated systems or lending a deaf ear to the voice of your customers will result in failure.

**Fame Gamer**
 Pride: Thinking that because you have knoweldge in a few niches that you have knoweldge in every niche, also pride can be being in reselling for 5 minutes and now you think you know it all. (humbl/ebrags on buying ps4's for 10 bucks at a neighbors yard sale) also for customers, they should be glad just to buy items from your fine establishment....
 thinking certain things are beneath you, extending your cash by reaching into your family investments?
 
**Pipe Dreamer**
 lust: wishing that you had all of the great thrift stores, auctions and resources that other resellers show online. you dont consider that you could do certan things to up your profits and merely get caught up in the glamour of high profits for seemingly no effort. You stop focusing n how to improve your business, and you start fantasizing about how easy it would be if you were superseller xyz. When the profits come crashing down so does your reality and it just gets you mad. Some people have all the luck, in fact they are probably using yours..... that can lead to the next deadly sin:
 
**Bucket Crab**
 Envy: when you are to the point that you disdain other resellers and their oportunities and cannot even see the things that you have. you are running from one guru to the other trying to do all the new tactics and tricks to get some spotlight from other resellers. its only worse that many resellers are you competition but you also want their admiration? So you put sugar in their gas tank by pretending to be a buyer but secretly are there to take them down a peg, get the account banned, cost them money, heartache and trouble , all the while you business ges down from all the focus that you have taken away from it.

**Recieving Hand Open - Giving Hand Closed**
 Gluttony: When you do the math on aproduct and you see 30 on the shelves and dont blink to clear it within a blink of an eye, and come back every restock day to clear them again. When you find that you have a rare item and instead of charging market rate on the item, you take advantage of the exclusivity and want to charge 2-3x the recently sold value. When you have information that helps your business thanks to the help of a guru but dont want that person to share with others the same way that they shared with you. The problem with this is that you do not get the opportunity to gain valuable friends and relationships that can sometimes lead to deals that you could never imagine.

**When things get odd, You Get Even**
 wrath: Using your position to make people miserable, abusing the pricing of items to "stick it to buyers" returning a load of items to a store because they upset you, threathening customers and other sellers and generally complaining in a woe is me lifestyle.being a jerk
 
 reselling is great and there is alot to be thankful for when you choose this as a full time.
