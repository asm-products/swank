###Avarice:

Keeping most of your valuable finds for yourself rather than selling them as planned. If you have more money going out to these items than coming in for an extended period of time, and you see nothing wrong with it, you may need to reconsider. If you get too overly attached to certain items in your inventory, you can create alot of clutter from mixing your "personal items" with things that you will actually allow to be sold. Hoarding can quickly become the poision apple in your reselling business.

Have you ever been given some quality advice or information that helps your business but don't want that helpful person to share the same with others? 

Having one hand open and the other hand closed stops you from making valuable friends and relationships that can sometimes lead to deals that you could never imagine.
 
###Slacking:

Although being a reseller seems as simple as buying low and selling high, and working at your own hours it requires more discipline than a regular 9 to 5 because you are self employed. If you do not show up for work: (sourcing, listing, shipping, buying supplies, customer support), _you will eventually have no profits to show for it._

Most Resellers can take care of the basics, but do not know how they are doing in regards to Bookkeeping and time management. This makes the difference between hobby and business. Poor research on items leads to having a surplus of items that sell very slowly, or not at all (resulting in loss).

Customer service is a crucial part of the sales equation and skimping on compassionate care in lieu of automated systems or lending a deaf ear to the voice of your customers will result in failure.

###Fame Gamer:

Having a good amount of knowledge in one item niche does not equal mastery of all. Don't be the seller that is new and a few months later knows it all. Reselling has a simple component, but there are suddle nuances that can take time to pick up on and use to your advantage. You may get excited with your first few homeruns, but you main goal should be finding a sustainable flow of flippable inventory. 

No matter what level you are in reselling, you will want to make sure not to get ahead of yourself, or dive into large investments without due dilligence. Even if you have alot of initial funds to begin with, you are low on experience, and poor choices will eat away at your flipping fund.

Boasting about your sourcing scores only gives your competitors more information on what you buy, and your potential profits. 
  
###Pipe Dreamer:

 You may be seeing many other resellers with excellent scores, and killer craigslist deals and wish that you lived in SuperSeller's state/region/country. Then you would __actually have a chance to make a decent income reselling___
 
It's easy to get caught up in the glamour of high profits for seemingly no effort. The downside is that you start fantisizing and you stop focusing on how to improve your business. Your inventory and sales begin to stagnate, and make the other sellers seem to have all of the good opportunities. 

Instead of looking at others and planning for when all your ducks are lined up perfectly, take an audit of your progress and see what can be done to get to the next level. 
 
###Bucket Crab:

When you are to the point that you dispise other resellers and their oportunities and cannot even see the opportunities that you have you can become bitter. You are running from one reseller guru to the next trying to do all of the latest tactics and tricks to get some recognition from other resellers.

It takes months and even years of trust and help to gain a good reputation and the trust of other sellers and buyers. 

You put sugar in their gas tank by pretending to be a buyer but are really a vengeful competitor there to take them down a peg, get their account banned, cost them money, heartache and trouble. 

###Being a Taker:

When you do the math on a product and you see 30 of them on the shelves and clear it within a blink of an eye, you've had a good day. If you are the type of person who will come back everyday that month and clean every store in your area out of the item each restock day, you may need to rethink your sourcing. (Wholesale instead of retail)

Have you ever found a rare item and instead of charging acceptable market rate on the item, you took advantage of the exclusivity and want to charge 2-3x the recently sold value? There's a thin line between Good Selling and Bad Scalping. Selling water for $27 per bottle in a hotel is a extreme markup and changes how consumers see you. 

Its one thing to take advantage of someone's needs and desires, but its another thing to exploit them and milk them for all that they are worth. 

###When things get odd, You Get Even

Using your position to make people miserable, abusing the pricing of items to "stick it to buyers" returning a load of items to a store because they upset you, threathening customers and other sellers and generally complaining in a woe is me lifestyle.being a jerk.
